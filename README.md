## Source code for analysis of the zoonotic niche of Ebolavirus

This repo contains R source code used to carry out the majority of the analysis for the eLife paper [*Mapping the zoonotic niche of Ebola virus disease in Africa*](http://elifesciences.org/content/early/2014/09/05/eLife.04395/).

Note that this repo is intended to allow readers to scrutinise the methodological approaches used, but not to fully reproduce the analysis, since the analysis relies on a number of very large data files (raster imagery, occurrence data etc.) The code is also designed to run on a 64-core machine so the model fitting would likely be very slow on most machines.
