## Source code for analysis of the zoonotic niche of Ebolavirus

This repo contains R source code used to carry out the majority of the analysis for the upcoming paper *Mapping the zoonotic niche of Ebola virus disease in Africa* by David Pigott, Nick Golding and others.

Note that this repo is intended to allow readers to scrutinise the methodological approaches used, but not to fully reproduce the analysis, since the analysis relies on a number of very large data files (raster imagery, occurrence data etc.) The code is also designed to run on a 64-core machine so the model fitting would likely be very slow on most machines.
